Error: 42 variants with 3+ alleles present.
* If you believe this is due to strand inconsistency, try --flip with
  post.modern/12.remerged/5.pobi.anc-merge.missnp.
  (Warning: if this seems to work, strand errors involving SNPs with A/T or C/G
  alleles probably remain in your data.  If LD between nearby SNPs is high,
  --flip-scan should detect them.)
* If you are dealing with genuine multiallelic variants, we recommend exporting
  that subset of the data to VCF (via e.g. '--recode vcf'), merging with
  another tool/script, and then importing the result; PLINK is not yet suited
  to handling them.
