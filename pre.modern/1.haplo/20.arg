	-r		20	Supply a single region in commandline (see examples below)
	-rf		(null)	Supply multiple regions in a file (see examples below)
	-remove_bads	1	Discard 'bad' reads, (flag >=256) 
	-uniqueOnly	0	Discards reads that doesn't map uniquely
	-show		0	Mimic 'samtools mpileup' also supply -ref fasta for printing reference column

	-minQ		13	Discard bases with base quality below
	-trim		0	Number of based to discard at both ends of the reads
	-trim		0	Number of based to discard at 5' ends of the reads
	-trim		0	Number of based to discard at 3' ends of the reads
